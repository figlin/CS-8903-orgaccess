# OrgAccess: A Benchmark for Role-Based Access Control in Organization Scale LLMs

## Dataset Description

The OrgAccess benchmark is a novel, synthetic dataset designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and operate within the complex constraints imposed by organizational hierarchies and role-based access control (RBAC) policies. This benchmark addresses the critical yet underexplored challenge of ensuring LLMs can reliably function as unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise settings while respecting nuanced organizational permissions.

Real-world corporate data and access control policies are often proprietary and sensitive, making it difficult to evaluate this crucial capability. To overcome this barrier, OrgAccess was developed through extensive collaboration with professionals from diverse organizational structures and backgrounds. The benchmark meticulously defines **40 distinct types of permissions** commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels.

OrgAccess tests LLMs' ability to:

* Accurately assess user permissions based on their role.
* Generate responses that strictly adhere to specified hierarchical rules.
* Navigate scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting permissions, a common source of real-world complexity.

The dataset includes a variety of test cases, organized by difficulty level, each containing:

* **`user_role`**: The role of the user making the request.
* **`permissions`**: A dictionary detailing the permissions associated with the user's role, including departments, access levels, allowed actions, session timeouts, deadlines, location restrictions, automation restrictions, and collaboration access.
* **`query`**: A natural language query from the user requesting access or actions.
* **`expected_response`**: The expected access control decision ('full', 'rejected', or 'partial') based on the user's permissions and the query.
* **`rationale`**: An explanation for the expected response, highlighting the specific permissions violated or satisfied.

## Intended Use

This benchmark is intended for researchers and practitioners working on:

* Evaluating the robustness and reliability of LLMs in enterprise environments.
* Identifying limitations in LLMs' complex rule following and compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based benchmarks.
* Developing new techniques and architectures for more reliable and hierarchy-aware LLMs.
* Understanding how well LLMs can handle nuanced access control scenarios with overlapping or conflicting permissions.

## Data Instances

Additionally, I need to generate a summary of the marketing campaigns that were run in the last six months and share it with the Sales department. I also need to ensure that all the data complies with the data residency laws and that the session timeout is set to 28 minutes. Furthermore, I need to collaborate with the HR department to update the onboarding process for new employees and ensure that all the data is securely stored and accessible from Delhi, Kansas, and Pueblo. I also need to ensure that the data is anonymized before sharing it with the customer support team for escalation purposes. Can you provide me with the necessary access and tools to complete these tasks?",

    "rationale": "The query involves accessing the financial reports of the marketing department which the user does not have explicit permissions to. Moreover, request for accessing of data from Delhi has been mentioned, which cannot be satisfied since India is not in the list of countries."
